### `Code Information`
I have created a simple frontend which takes user input and gives 1st n fibonacci numbers.
Starting point is Index.js. React Router Dom is used for routing and I refered to official documentation of react router dom to implement it.

## Note - I entered 0,1 as first two entries when I created table, rest calculated using fibonacci function

App.js files has defined routes with default route as Main.js
When user will enter N, he/she will be redirected to getResult endpoint where we will get result from Db
Here, I used axios library for HTTP requests and some other relevant information will be there in comments
